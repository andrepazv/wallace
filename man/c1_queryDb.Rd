\title{Query online database for species occurrence records.}
\usage{
c1_queryDb(spNames, occDb, occNum, doCitations = FALSE,
  gbifUser = NULL, gbifEmail = NULL, gbifPW = NULL, logger = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{occDb}{character biodiversity database to query; current choices are
"gbif", "vertnet", and "bison"}

\item{occNum}{numeric maximum number of occurrence records to return}

\item{doCitations}{set TRUE to use `occCite` to get a complete list of original
data sources in a citable format}

\item{gbifUser}{specify only if using `occCite` with GBIF to get a complete list
of original data sources in a citable format. This, as well as `gbifEmail`
and `gbifPW` are constraints imposed by GBIF to obtain the complete set of
metadata associated with occurrence records and is not stored or used by
`wallace` for any other purposes.}

\item{gbifEmail}{specify only if using `occCite` with GBIF to get a
complete list of original data sources in a citable format.}

\item{logger}{insert the logger reactive list here for running in shiny,
otherwise leave the default NULL}

\item{spName}{character species Latin name, with format "Genus species"}

\item{gbifPW=NULL}{specify only if using `occCite` with GBIF to get a complete
list of original data sources in a citable format.}

\value{
formatted tibble of species occurrence records
}
\description{
\code{c1_queryDb} returns a formatted tibble of species occurrences with a selection of appropriate fields.
}
\details{
This function is called by the module mod_c1_queryDb to query a database for
species occurrence records, subset to only those records with coordinates,
remove records with duplicate coordinates, and select some columns with fields
appropriate to studies in biogeography.
}
\examples{
c1_queryDb(spName = "Tremarctos ornatus", occDb = "gbif", occNum = 100)
}
